I love the subtle use of powers--I'm still thinking about the lady who can touch objects and see their history--and the in/out of characters never made me feel like anyone was forgotten within such a huge ensemble cast. Honey Harper has a special place in my heart; she ate up every scene and I hope we see more of her in the coming books.<br/><br/>Now Meyer is known for her romance, and she does disappoint to some extent here. I enjoyed the POV shifts in this book, which is unique from what I've read of hers before. Both Aiden and Nova have secrets they're trying to keep from each other, and I like how we as the reader are privy to both so we can watch how they try to circumnavigate each other while also in forced proximity. There are cute moments and returning banter, but it was never truly enough to make me see them as potential romantic partners right up until the end of an amusement park scene. I think I just need mcs to stop saying how attractive a person is right out the gate; it's becoming a lazy subtle nod that these two will be romantically interested in each other before they ever have any real chemistry.

She's a straight-A student who can't handle anything less, doesn't trust other people to do work she could do herself, and judges others very easily if they don't align with her viewpoint around academia/financial success. And it doesn't hurt that I'm from a tourist town with a low middle-class family background. Seriously, did Marissa Meyer go back in time and observe me at 16?? Prue sings to my heart in a way that can make me laugh while she's clearly in the wrong but just doesn't know it yet. I know; I lived it.<br/><br/>And Meyer either seemed to have lived it too or really understands how teenagers are because the other characters do not miss. Everyone starts out one dimensional: the overachiever, the slacker, the brother, the best friend, the activist, the mean girl crush, etc. But as the story goes on and wacky Karma powers kick in, Prue begins to see the people she grew up with as more than what she labeled them (and vice versa). I absolutely love how subtle and organic the growth is in this regard. The author packs a lot of setup, and for the most part, they pay off.<br/><br/>I only wish that the Karma plotline somehow ended up helping Prue's family and their business, or Prue's growth into an event coordinator would have helped them at the end. That was the last string I was left feeling untucked. I liked the scene where Prue's mother explains that these things they're giving away are just stuff, and I like the sentiment that the exploration of their lives are more important than the items left behind by people long gone, but they're still struggling. They're still having to do Band-Aid solutions, and I don't think I have to read the second book in order for that to at least be hinted at or starting to resolve by the end of this one.",,,1,0

I wish we had more time to explore each location further since they are so interesting, giving both the reader and characters some brevity between cut-throat action sequences.

And I think it's even more of a gamble to write the entirety of the first book through his experiences rather than something completely new like an origin story.<br/><br/>The gamble pays off...for the most part. Any time the book does invest time into Edward's vampiric origins, family dynamics, and powers, I am the most intrigued because that's something we can't get organically (or at the very least as quickly) through Bella's POV. Comparing <i>Midnight Sun</i> to <i>Twilight</i>, my favorite additions are in regards to Edward's vampire life up until the events of the first book and moments where we read the Cullens' reactions to Bella as their relationship deepens. Literally every Cullen is so much more interesting through Edward's POV because we can actually spend time with them. Even Esme.<br/><br/>Where the book sours for me is the paranormal romance between Edward and Bella, which does save itself by the end but is severely harder to believe through Edward's POV compared to Bella's. I love the progression from vicious killer to vicious protector, but there's enough drawbacks to make me cover my mouth from a cringe rather than a sheepish smile. For one, Edward calls her ""the girl"" even after he learns about her name? What's that about? For two, Edward falling head over heels makes me start to hate Bella. This is because Meyers adds more dialogue details to their interactions that don't exist in the first book, and boy did she <i>not</i> need to because all of a sudden Bella becomes this agglomeration of the best female protagonists in classic literature. His view on Bella becomes disingenuous with these added details that aren't present in <i>Twilight</i>. We don't know Bella like that, which wouldn't be a problem if there weren't 4 books written for us to know Bella like that. Her concern for others, selflessness, and stubbornness are very clearly illustrated from her actions presented in the original saga. No need to tell us how she switched lockers with someone so two friends could have lockers side by side. It can be argued that Bella wouldn't share those details to the reader because she is someone who is so humble and reserved that she wouldn't flaunt how kind she is, but it happens too much for me to connect with her the way I did literally through her own book.

This introduction into Maas's fae series is quite the slowburn, not just in its romance but also in its story. Up until the midpoint where we reach our Fire Night scene, Feyre's journey is relatively stagnant for someone who was kidnapped by a dangerous creature and forced to live with him away from everything she's ever known. As readers, we don't worry for her family's potential starvation the way she does. It's just not something we care about considering their negative/harmful relationship to her and how Tamlin (the fae who kidnaps her) seemingly takes care of them in her absence. As much as I hate how a lot of faerie lore is tossed out the window, I was really hoping they would use the sudden ability to lie in a meaningful way. What if Tamlin isn't actually taking care of them the way he says he is? That would have made Feyre's insistence to find a loophole and escape something we can actually grab onto and want to follow her through that thought-process. But no; it's just faerie lore tossed out the window.<br/><br/>What does grab my attention is the introduction of Rhysand, a potentially even more dangerous High Lord of the Night Court. He's the wrench that actually gets the plot-ball rolling because he adds conflict, fear, stakes, momentum--you get the idea. Up until he walks into Tamlin's dining room, all of the relationships between characters feels muddled (outside of the three sisters; that's clear and great). It's only when Rhysand enters the chat that I actually feel any real connection between Feyre, Tamlin, and Lucien. They're finally being confronted with something and have to do so together and in their own way. I wish there was more brewing tension before Rhysand's arrival; it's like the characters are all waiting for the next big thing to happen the same way you wait for the train to arrive for your morning commute--not when you're tied to the tracks, clawing at your restraints, counting down the seconds until the train strikes you.<br/><br/>The trials are great. I love how everything has weight, how everyone uses Feyre for their own gain, and ultimately, how love triumphs all. There's plenty of foreshadowing of what is to come next, and the book ends on a comforting note that leaves you itchy for the next installment.

It was the first time we see death on a personal level in this series, and it's a complete waste not to mourn for people you've made us care about. We're supposed to believe that America's journey is over when that cannot be further from the truth. Wrapping up the revolution loose ends in their first year of marriage should have been the 4th and final book and this subsequence Heir/Crown duology should have come later.<br/><br/>That being said, I've tried to give this book a fair shake. After all, it does exist despite my protest. I like that Eadlyn is a dislikable character; her unique position as the first female heir mixed with her privileged position means she's distant, unsympathetic, and shallow. Which makes for great conflict with the relationship she has with herself, the Selected, and the country at large.<br/><br/>However, Eadlyn doesn't become someone we can root for or root against. There's sparse moments where we as the reader want her to disrupt the Selection or embrace it. I simply don't care nearly as much because the stakes aren't worrisome. With America, she could be eliminated at any moment, and there's real fear in Maxon's decision to keep or boot her. With Eadlyn, she is the one eliminating. I like how the author makes us root for a lot more of the Selected instead of the original trilogy's love triangle, but unfortunately that means that all of them would make a great choice and I'm not as worried about who she chooses. (Team Erik though if I get any say).<br/><br/>I also would be amiss if I didn't mention the pacing. What has worked for Kiera Cass in the past is not working here. There was nothing satisfying about Eadlyn finally taking the Selection seriously the same way it's satisfying for America to take her role as the Selected seriously.

Am I cursed? The urgency in which I needed to read this story is unnatural. The need for me to compile an angry playlist for EvaJacks is vicious.<br/><br/>The pacing in <i>The Ballad of Never After</i> is way better than its predecessor. The story beats are much more fleshed out, and there is a stronger balance between the tense/action moments and the calm/recovery moments. I will remember this one a lot more than I will the first; every interaction adds more and more tension between Evangeline and Jacks, and we get a stronger understanding for his actions even when they hurt. Especially when they hurt. I still think it's hard for me to fully fall for him the way I'm so clearly meant to because I've dated guys who don't know how or refuse to express their true feelings and that's why it only works in fantasy. But I'm hopeful that the third will force him to do what he's been holding back from so far.<br/><br/>And what continues to make me so conflicted is the obviousness of story elements vs the obliviousness of our leading gal. I like that Evangeline is naïve and trusting and wants to see the good in people; that makes her a great foil to Jacks and ultimately defines her as a person. But she's also categorized and seen as clever and contemplative; she's constantly trying to figure out Jacks thoughts/motives/feelings and there are key moments where she gets herself out of a bind by outsmarting the people around her or using something she shouldn't know to her advantage. Her actions and important ""I didn't think before I acted"" moments in this book contradict with what we've already established, and I can't stand it. <spoiler>(The major exception being her finally realizing that she loves Jacks and could potentially break his curse through the power of love; that makes sense that she didn't think about that before now. But you're gonna tell me that she didn't once think that the arch hidden away behind a magically-locked door supposedly holding the Valor secrets could in fact be the Valory arch she's swore not to open?

At this point, Meyer is having point of view switches for every major character and the book reads like a movie because of it. The most cinematic book I've ever read, and I never grew bored. I'm amazed at how Meyer can deviate her titular characters in terms of personality, actions, and inner thoughts while also managing for them to work together in unexpected and natural ways. The same goes for romance pairs. You'd think Meyer couldn't invest us into a fourth couple, but she caught me in a snar with a princess/body-guard trope. I love how everyone collides here.

Erin Craig knows how to use my imagination against me in her writing. She's a horror novelist through and through; even as I was terrified in my own home, I kept reading into the witching hour because the story is so gripping. Everything works: the setting of an isolated town, a close-knit community with long-standing grudges, unknown monsters beyond the forest line, and a lead who must keep her family afloat through the turmoil that follows. The seasonal sections and the throws of surviving winter reminds me of <i>The Grace Year</i>, and the moments of reprieve are not just enjoyable but hold hidden meaning that will come important later.<br/><br/>I wish the bees held a little more importance in the climax; I expected her skills and affinity for the bees to help her understand the threat better but the way they stand is perfectly fine, especially as it relates to her familial relationships and her own sense of self. And ironically I wish the titular Small Favors were more ever-present. I was like 80% of the way through this book and was like ""where are the small favors?"". I can understand keeping this a secret from the main character and by extension the reader, but the title and synopsis explicitly reference how these monsters ask for small favors and we only experience *one* first-hand. Feels like a missed opportunity to either keep that thread a secret or have favors pile on top of each other until they escalate into something dangerous. Still great otherwise.",,,1,0

There were times where I genuinely hated him, and that helped drive the decision making into something much more daunting and ambiguous.

It was there in the first book when she personally lead her maids to a safe room (and became their friends), but Kiera Cass takes full advantage of her background in a poor caste to stand out against the remaining girls.

Prince Maxon and America understand that she's just here to eat cake and recover from her breakup, so they team up as friends. There's a few times where she helps steer him in the direction of a few girls, but not a lot of the story or their initial time together is devoted to that. I would have loved to see a few more scenes where she's mapping out all the girls, giving him advice on conversation, and who to mingle with until she realizes she wants that attention too. I also wish that the book was a little longer so we could have more time with each contestant, at least the ones who become the final six that start the next book.

If we were going to do a 5 month time jump between the Prologue and Chapter 1, we need more context for Roman and Iris's relationship. How long have they been competing? What are other past examples not yet revealed when they faced off? All we get is a comment or two about winning/losing but not anything we can latch on to. We're just told and expected to be in agreeance. I enjoyed when Roman shows up in the latter half of the book and Iris is convinced he's there to one-up her. That was fun. We needed more of that in the beginning. Now if you're here for a love story where the boy falls hard, then you're in the right place because boy oh boy does Roman fall HARD and it's glorious.<br/><br/>Secondly, and this bothered me as an editor/writer, why is Iris calling her mother by her first name? It would have been an incredible literary device for Iris's POV to use Aster when she's actively separating her mother from the alcoholic she has to deal with. Aster is used randomly and seems to only break up the word ""mom"" when that's not necessary. There's another line later on about how every woman in her family is named after flowers, but we didn't need Aster before this for us to understand. Just one line about ""hey my mom's name is Aster and mine is Iris isn't that neat"" and we're good.<br/><br/>And then thirdly, Iris needed more internal dialogue. I always understood how Roman felt and why he did things. The ending especially is when I needed Iris to explain herself the most. The ending is great; it's tense, there's drama, regret, and loss but Iris is way too passive afterwards. I need to know why because everything else about her character screams otherwise. Just a few lines Rebecca. I needed a few lines to just gaslight me into believing her final actions are justified and a little more internal dialogue to understand what she'll do in the sequel.",,,1,0

Dora is the only person who can match wits with Lord Sorcier Elias because of her faerie-cursed condition, and the two find themselves constantly in each other's company to the dismay of everyone else who are within the confines of propriety. I love how their relationship naturally blossoms from a rude introduction to sudden allies, friends, and then lovers. I love how his very presence is often unexpected and pleasing to both the reader and to Dora, and I love how the characters outside of their dynamic hinder or help their cause. The book is concise though, which isn't a drawback until the very end, when the final battle becomes underwhelming by how quickly it passes by. Elias is the Lord Sorcier. Let the man unleash his full power. Make him a little scary so he has the same sense of hesitation and fear as Dora does when their feelings are revealed. The writing style itself is a little stilted in the beginning too, which is fine when Dora doesn't have the same emotional capacity as everyone else, but she has her full soul in the first chapter so I wished the writing reflected that.

And you definitely get those juicy moments, but I found myself constantly frustrated at the main character, who honestly as I'm writing this I can't remember her name. There's nothing inherently wrong with her, and the story works as is. I just couldn't help but feel a strong desire to rewrite her personality to be a lot kinder and meeker in stark contrast to her new companion. I'd find their dynamic more compelling, his softened heart more natural, and those moments when she does do bad things more shocking. Again, it works as is that she takes on her sister's traits in order to find her killer; I ended up not liking it as much as the alternative.

There's a lot of merits to this book: a dark academia setting, a lot of toying mysteries, and an enticing use of language. However, I find myself incredibly disappointed at the complete normalcy of the plot once you get down to it. Without giving spoilers, the supernatural and I mean in the scariest of terms, does not come back into the story. Its consequences create more consequences but not at the cosmic scale I was expecting and hoping. The other toying mysteries are great but like a double edged sword, are only used to make me read more than to give me any answer, satisfying or unsatisfying. And by God this book is loooooong. I appreciate the patience the author has to write so much detail, but it doesn't bring me any tension or worry for most of the second half. When interesting things do happen in this ladder half, it's again enticing for me to keep reading but is either passed off casually or never addressed again in a meaningful way.

I'm always in Ancient Greece and always on my toes. The romance is believable and heartbreaking, and I honestly became desperate myself toward the end as things turned sour. Its smart for Miller to write the first half as Achilles and Patroclus's budding romance and childhood and then exactly at the midpoint bring them into the Trojan War. However, I must admit that the pacing after chapter three can feel slow as we're building the setting and romance and sometimes the pacing of the war can do the same because it's stretched out over a 10 year timeframe. Miller always finds a way to bring tension back into play, and the long descriptives between Achilles and Patroclus make my heart flutter instead of drag. I don't think this book is categorized as Young Adult, but if it is, would not recommend for younger audiences. Themes around rape, the treatment of women, and explicit sex scenes in general put The Song of Achilles into the New Adult genre, bare minimum.",,,1,0

Melinda's voice is distinctly teenage, managing to be authentic without being cringey. To even say ""Melinda's voice"" is ironic because Anderson does a fantastic job getting into her headspace without her speaking outloud throughout most of the novel. I love the story keeping the pace of an entire school year following the incident, and I like how 'the incident' isn't explicitly said until we're nearing the end of the book. We know from context or just reading the synopsis, but Melinda isn't able to properly acknowledge her rape until she's at a point where she can process and tell others. I also love symbolism, so the tree assignment really piqued my intrigue, and I enjoyed the worldbuilding surrounding her school with all the clans, teachers, and classes.

I also enjoyed moments of good humor, haunting parallels of the past, and how our main group of teens developed from start to finish. I will admit that the contemporary writing style is sometimes awkward or cringy for me to read and there were points in the book where something was reminded too frequently like it didn't trust us to remember. The biggest example is how many times Starr reminds me that some stores have ""Black Owned"" spraypainted on them. I got it the 1st time, didn't need it the 5th time within the same chapter. Those are minor details and can be chopped up to personal preference. Overall, the writing style is successful in its distinct Starr voice and truly who am I to hinder her greatest weapon?",,,1,0

I separate community from people because Lee really highlights how individuals are complex and can reflect or oppose the general consensus. At first, I was hesitant with the ""slice of life"" beginning of this book but I quickly became invested. As the plot started rolling, its impact is much more hitting than if it started in the first 3 chapters as books tend to do these days. I can understand why high schools wouldn't want to read it in class just because I can see kids memeing on the frequent n-word but it shouldn't be banned.

At first, I thought I wouldn't like the storytelling: how Monique's insecure thoughts have a lot to do with the progression of the first several chapters but I adored Evelyn's manner of speech and I enjoyed how that confidence started to influence Monique's point of view too.

If the story didn't end in the way that it did like a season 1 finale opening the door wide for season 2, there would be better closure writing several more chapters to end this feud or their lives or their familial ties or however else Gong decides is the right ending. I do like, however, how Juliette repays Roma for how he saved her without her understanding and that essentially flips their relationship dynamic on its head for Book 2 to thrive in new and interesting ways alongside the loose story threads introduced but not closed in Book 1.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this dive into 1920's Shanghai and the commentary on race, colonialism, and gender within Juliette's thoughts. The characters are uniquely their own and enjoyable to follow. My favorite character outside of the main duo was Kathleen, and her segments trying to find information were just as riveting as following the gang heirs. There's body horror here, which I was not expecting, but is by far my favorite horror subgenre, and even though a lot of people die from the same infliction, Gong reminds me every time why I want to run away. The enemies to lovers romance is believable and a great slowburn. I'm seriously at a loss as to how they are going to recover in Book 2, but considering how well Gong steers her story here, I'm confident it will be in all the ways I least expect.",,,1,0
