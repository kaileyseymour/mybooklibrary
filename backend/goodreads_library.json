It's explicit, but the way Haymitch must constantly confront complicit compliance always left me with goosebumps. He's damned if he does and he's damned if he doesn't, and that adds to the overall hopelessness and tension threaded throughout this story. I won't say anymore because I want you to read it!",

I want to stare at this cover for the rest of my life.<br/><br/><i>The Hedgewitch of Foxhall</i> was full of Welsh magic; I think I was teleported into a Cartoon Saloon movie (yes I know they do Irish folklore but it has the VIBES). Ffion has my whole heart; she is a wild, fiery redhead who does not stop once she's started. The romance is swoony (and not spicy for those who are worried); I usually don't like love triangles but I was sat for this one. And the way the author reveals small facets of this world and its characters is masterful. <spoiler>The way I gasped over who the court magician was;</spoiler> something almost irrelevant in the beginning becomes drastically important later. I want to learn how to write like this, truly.",

   "My Review": "Returning to the <i>Kingdom of the Wicked</i> world was a fun time! I didn't realize how adult these books already were until I started reading other, more explicitly adult works, so I wouldn't say this is her first adult novel but you do you Little, Brown and Company.<br/><br/>The Prince of Envy was my favorite character in her original series, so he's just even more enjoyable here. I love the game at play and the conflict between characters here--seriously, the opposing forces at work are excellent. And I loved reading the princes interact. We didn't get so much of that in the original trilogy. However, I still found myself force reading this book here and there despite enjoying the story. Hopefully that's not everyone's experience; I found this book to be really long and the stakes suffering because of it.",

   "My Review": "An absolute nail-biter. Marissa Meyer puts in the work to make me believe Nova and Aiden are falling in love with each other while simultaneously tearing me up at the seams as they try to outmaneuver each other. The dread, action, and conflict are all here making a terribly delicious concoction; the ending really pulls everything together with a menace. A part of me laughed out loud that home girl added a gala scene (the contemporary version of a ballroom scene and also the finale of her <i>Instant Karma</i> book), but I get it--they're hard to resist. And there are a couple of slow moments that could have prolonged my reading if I wasn't listening to the audiobook. Nevertheless, this is a superhero/villain story still worth your time, and my jaw is already dropped going into <i>Supernova</i>.",

Nesta's journey is palpable and resonated with me in ways I didn't expect; I became encouraged to keep my fitness goals and forgave a friend who I didn't realize still hurt my feelings. That's crazy.

   "My Review": "3.5 ⭐<br/><br/>This book taught me that sometimes Prologues should be left on the cutting room floor. The slow exposition dump at the beginning really dragged out the excitement the rest of <i>Renegades</i> carries, and I laughed out loud at the naming convention of Ace Anarchy. Obviously I got used to it, but I imagine most people don't want their reader to immediately not take the central villain seriously.<br/><br/>Meyer draws from superhero comics in a fun and engaging way after the fact: everyone has unique abilities, backstories, and their relationships to each other directly relate to a world built organically. I love the subtle use of powers--I'm still thinking about the lady who can touch objects and see their history--and the in/out of characters never made me feel like anyone was forgotten within such a huge ensemble cast. Honey Harper has a special place in my heart; she ate up every scene and I hope we see more of her in the coming books.<br/><br/>Now Meyer is known for her romance, and she does disappoint to some extent here. I enjoyed the POV shifts in this book, which is unique from what I've read of hers before. Both Aiden and Nova have secrets they're trying to keep from each other, and I like how we as the reader are privy to both so we can watch how they try to circumnavigate each other while also in forced proximity. There are cute moments and returning banter, but it was never truly enough to make me see them as potential romantic partners right up until the end of an amusement park scene. I think I just need mcs to stop saying how attractive a person is right out the gate; it's becoming a lazy subtle nod that these two will be romantically interested in each other before they ever have any real chemistry. Nevertheless, I'm excited to see how their relationship pans out in <i>Archenemies</i> because THAT ENDING--",

   "My Review": "I'm so disappointed. The premise starts strong but is executed with little confidence. The writing lacks subtlety as the story progresses, and there are several unnecessary scenes and locational decisions that could be either cut or refined. There is absolutely no reason why an author should feel the need to explain the enemies-to-lovers trope for the characters to tease each other with; it's not cheeky, it's incredibly meta in a world already difficult to immerse yourself in. I thoroughly enjoyed the blooming romantic beats between Chrysantha and Eryx--I really wish the couch/chair scene was in a much better book so I could recommend it to other people.",

   "My Review": "Contemporary romance is <i>not</i> my go-to genre, but I'm on a mission to read all of Marissa Meyer's works this year and <i>Instant Karma</i> caught my attention more than her others in the same section.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this book, and it probably has a lot to do about how Prue reflects myself in high school. She's a straight-A student who can't handle anything less, doesn't trust other people to do work she could do herself, and judges others very easily if they don't align with her viewpoint around academia/financial success. And it doesn't hurt that I'm from a tourist town with a low middle-class family background. Seriously, did Marissa Meyer go back in time and observe me at 16?? Prue sings to my heart in a way that can make me laugh while she's clearly in the wrong but just doesn't know it yet. I know; I lived it.<br/><br/>And Meyer either seemed to have lived it too or really understands how teenagers are because the other characters do not miss. Everyone starts out one dimensional: the overachiever, the slacker, the brother, the best friend, the activist, the mean girl crush, etc. But as the story goes on and wacky Karma powers kick in, Prue begins to see the people she grew up with as more than what she labeled them (and vice versa). I absolutely love how subtle and organic the growth is in this regard. The author packs a lot of setup, and for the most part, they pay off.<br/><br/>I only wish that the Karma plotline somehow ended up helping Prue's family and their business, or Prue's growth into an event coordinator would have helped them at the end. That was the last string I was left feeling untucked. I liked the scene where Prue's mother explains that these things they're giving away are just stuff, and I like the sentiment that the exploration of their lives are more important than the items left behind by people long gone, but they're still struggling. They're still having to do Band-Aid solutions, and I don't think I have to read the second book in order for that to at least be hinted at or starting to resolve by the end of this one.",

As much as I understand why Wren can't have a POV for the mystery to work, I can't help but note that the writing style related to her perspective is what enchanted me in this duology, which is not present here.",

   "My Review": "Bumping this up to 4 ⭐ after reading <i>The Prisoner's Throne</i>.<br/><br/>Holly Black is back and she's returning me to Elfhame. I love Wren as the trash goblin she is and a unique inverse to Jude, to be a Fae who wants to belong in the human world. The prose is gorgeous; I was always left feeling more adrift and introspective after reading through Wren's POV.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I became quite detached from the plot as a whole. Their journey, interesting in itself, had a destination I couldn't find myself invested in. Lady Nore and the threat she poses is distant and never feels out of control, and her relationship to Wren is way more intriguing in the backstory we receive rather than in the current moment. Even the ending, albeit engaging, also confused me. Oak and Wren's relationship and interactions are great, but I didn't see any foreshadowing that would suggest the decisions made that make this book a duology.",

   "My Review": "I would be in denial if I didn't give the last book in the Caraval series a 5 stars. Finally, Stephanie Garber adds trial and error in her work (maybe a little too much in this one but c'est la vie). It might be odd to cheer for so many things going wrong and for plans to constantly be changing, but my usual critique of her storylines are how convenient they feel. Maybe the cause and effect is so natural, but I often find these high-stake situations pointedly linear. That is not the case for <i>Finale</i>. I was worried at first that Donatella would overtake her sister for best pov, but their storylines end up being just as interesting as the book progresses. Well done. The Evangeline cameo was something I was not expecting either but fully adored.",

   "My Review": "The introduction of Jacks was everything I could ever ask for from this universe. I was genuinely surprised to find myself liking Tella a lot more in this novel than I did her character in the first book. Though <i>Legendary</i> is in her pov and that'll help me understand her better, it's the way Garber challenges her in the second installment that makes me respect and enjoy her story more. I also like that there's a clear difference in how each sister plays the game of Caraval based off their personalities and past experience with where they were in the first game. Unfortunately, the ending didn't grab me the way the first book's ending did; I'm going to complete the trilogy only to say I did rather than any gripping need to know what happens next.",

   "My Review": "Stephanie Garber always conflicts me. She's fantastic at romantic tension, uncertain heroines, and keeping me caught on her every word. And those words are full of color, hype specific descriptions, and intrigue. It's the sisterly devotion that I couldn't quite connect with; the drive that keeps Scarlet going. The plot always somehow feels both convenient and the most out of pocket, too. I don't think I'd read so much of her work if it wasn't for Rebecca Soler reading the audiobooks. And yet I am reading with abandon every second I can.",

   "My Review": "I thought this would be a slam dunk 5 until the final battle occurred. I loved the first 3/4ths of this book! Coming in from Book 2, Feyre <i>is</i> the High Lady of the Night Court and takes a lot more strides moving the plot along with her newfound confidence and role. All of the characters are given unique conflicts with themselves and each other that kept me on my toes even in the most neutral of dialogue scenes. Hybern is terrifying as a central villain, and his newfound threat to the world left me genuinely wondering how they were going to prevail. Tamlin's ever dual and uncertain nature was honestly peak; I don't understand how y'all can hate him so much.<br/><br/>The ending is just unnecessarily funny. It cycles hollow goodbyes and ex machinas in such a loop that I can't take it seriously anymore (the exception being Nesta and Cassian because they were in the most genuine danger). Earlier confrontations with the main antagonist held more weight and more of my breath in equal measure. The final battle is fun, but it seriously drags down the narrative with poor writing, lowered stakes, and a wave of new characters that should have either had their own book or pov chapters alongside the main story. Give me the Lucien POV you coward!",

   "My Review": "A thrilling, jam-packed debut! <i>The Twelve Kingdoms</i> has a world and narrative structure identical to DnD, so if you love high fantasy and quest stories that move like a campaign, this book is a must read. It even has that slow burning feel at the beginning of the story where characters are thrown together and only fit into a puzzle the more they endure together as a team. There are also a LOT of twists and turns, some I could figure out easily and some I could not <i>imagine</i>, so prepare to be on edge throughout your read. I love Rose's internal journey; she faces triumphs and tribulations that don't always have a clean getaway, fitting right in with the rise of feminine characters making mistakes and having to endure their consequences. Her, Animo, and Ketch are the standouts--if they get hurt, I get hurt.<br/><br/>Caldwell does her due diligence to make sure you feel how large and expansive the world is through its set pieces and plethora of characters. I wish we had more time to explore each location further since they are so interesting, giving both the reader and characters some brevity between cut-throat action sequences. It was also difficult for me to connect with some secondary characters as more attention was given to those who would be pinnacle to the story's progression, but I admire how there's an entire glossary space given to share each character's name, pronunciation, and description. I await the sequel!",

   "My Review": "Maas is insane for this and I love it<br/><br/>The writing is incredibly strong in this entry. Tamlin's evolution is so natural and believable, I often found myself catching up with Feyre's exact thoughts as they're happening. Her despondence, depression, and revival is palpable. Rhysand steals every scene he's in as normal, and I enjoyed the introduction of new characters, Amren being my favorite.",

   "My Review": "Let Levana say f*ck<br/><br/>I'm fortunate enough to read this <i>after</i> reading the main series. I've noticed that those who read in strict publishing order often did not have a good time with this book, and honestly, I'm sure I would have been the same back in 2015. The audiobook, as always, is incredible, and makes for an easier time to gawk, pace around the room, and be horrified. Simply put, you cannot be still when reading how disturbing Levana is as she shapes herself into the Evil Queen. Rebecca Soler is my favorite voice actor hands down.",

   "My Review": "There are some books that I need to read so insistently that I run to B&N before my library can give it to me. This is one of those books.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved the mystery at play here and how revelations pile on top of each other as the story progresses (two are even on the last page). I enjoyed the expansion of the world and how seemingly small details in the first book become insanely important in this one. I read <i>Apprentice to the Villain</i> next to my fiancé and often found myself squealing, kicking my feet, and then repeating the scene to him because he has to know why I'm quaking. The humor is turned up three full notches and works incredibly well.<br/><br/>The only thing that stops me from calling this perfection is how quickly Trystan returns to Evie's side after the events of Book 1, but I won't dare try to tell you how I would have changed anything because the first seven chapters are so good, I wouldn't want that to go away...but maybe go wrong?<br/><br/>I have no idea what the third book is going to be called but I vote: <i>A Prodigy to the Villain</i>",

   "My Review": "3.5 ⭐<br/><br/>Honestly what a power move on Stephanie Meyer's part to return 15 years later and give us Edward's POV during a rise of YA books including the male lead's perspective, particularly the experience of falling in love. And I think it's even more of a gamble to write the entirety of the first book through his experiences rather than something completely new like an origin story.<br/><br/>The gamble pays off...for the most part. Any time the book does invest time into Edward's vampiric origins, family dynamics, and powers, I am the most intrigued because that's something we can't get organically (or at the very least as quickly) through Bella's POV. Comparing <i>Midnight Sun</i> to <i>Twilight</i>, my favorite additions are in regards to Edward's vampire life up until the events of the first book and moments where we read the Cullens' reactions to Bella as their relationship deepens. Literally every Cullen is so much more interesting through Edward's POV because we can actually spend time with them. Even Esme.<br/><br/>Where the book sours for me is the paranormal romance between Edward and Bella, which does save itself by the end but is severely harder to believe through Edward's POV compared to Bella's. I love the progression from vicious killer to vicious protector, but there's enough drawbacks to make me cover my mouth from a cringe rather than a sheepish smile. For one, Edward calls her \"the girl\" even after he learns about her name? What's that about? For two, Edward falling head over heels makes me start to hate Bella. This is because Meyers adds more dialogue details to their interactions that don't exist in the first book, and boy did she <i>not</i> need to because all of a sudden Bella becomes this agglomeration of the best female protagonists in classic literature. His view on Bella becomes disingenuous with these added details that aren't present in <i>Twilight</i>. We don't know Bella like that, which wouldn't be a problem if there weren't 4 books written for us to know Bella like that. Her concern for others, selflessness, and stubbornness are very clearly illustrated from her actions presented in the original saga. No need to tell us how she switched lockers with someone so two friends could have lockers side by side. It can be argued that Bella wouldn't share those details to the reader because she is someone who is so humble and reserved that she wouldn't flaunt how kind she is, but it happens too much for me to connect with her the way I did literally through her own book. Great and unexpected use of a <i>Somewhere in Time</i> reference though. You got me there.",

   "My Review": "I wish this book series had the same momentum given to franchises like <i>The Hunger Games</i> simply so I can delegate out \"Which country are you from in the Grishaverse?\" tests and talk extensively about each character and their best quotes, character developments, and pairings. I guess the closest we have to that right now is in the ACOTAR fandom, and I don't want to be involved there.<br/><br/>Simply put, I love the Grishaverse Bardugo has created. I love how this duology and this book especially dives into the dangers of war tech progression, religious corruption, and social change. I love how characters come together like it's a reunion party. When Kaz Brekker entered the scene, I was so excited! I love how these books can make me cry during burial services because I've grown so attached. And I love how no character is wasted. We find out those with smaller roles in both <i>King of Scars</i> and <i>Rule of Wolves</i> are mentioned in the threads of the other two series. I kept saying:<br/><br/><img src=\"https://tenor.com/view/that-worked-out-perfectly-gif-25077660.gif\" width=\"120\" height=\"200\"></img><br/><br/>not because things go well but how things connect from what we've established before.<br/><br/>Do I wish that Nina stayed tied to <spoiler>Matthias</spoiler>? Absolutely. Do I find what she's doing insane, fascinating, and believable? Also absolutely. Do I completely agree with the ending? Absolutely not. But is it insane, fascinating, and believable? Absolutely. DID I WANT A GENYA POV? ABSOLUTELY. But it wouldn't have added anything in the grand scheme of things. I just love Genya. Real Poppy vibes from the UN trilogy.",

   "My Review": "<i>\"We have some bad news.<br/>There's more?<br/>It's Ravka. there's always more.\"</i><br/><br/>This book goes HARD, expanding on the world as Ravka faces the consequences of civil war and the events brought about by our favorite thieves in Ketterdam. There are so many escalations happening in this story, but Bardugo manages to keep you interested, surprised, and above all else, hopeful.<br/><br/>Multi-POVs return, and it's just as brilliantly handled as it is in <i>Six of Crows</i>. Nikolai's pov is so natural alongside how we know him from the <i>Shadow and Bone</i> trilogy, and Zoya's pov is a great contrast, especially with how little we understand her from the original books. She quickly became one of my favorite characters. Her anger, sorrow, and resentment is understandable in its grief. The author even manages to introduce a completely new character in the second half of this story who you immediately want to protect at all costs. Isaak and Nina's storylines were my favorite only because their stakes were ever-present and one slip up meant immediate danger.<br/><br/>Had the second book READY after that jaw-dropping conclusion.",

   "My Review": "This is a romance I can find myself returning to for cute moments, punchy dialogue, and steamy payoffs. I've never read an Ali Hazelwood romance, and if I'm being honest, I thought she would be terrible at it? But this (and I cannot stress enough) is a <i>great</i> love story with all the fun entanglements that come with an arranged marriage between a vampire and werewolf.<br/><br/>Misery and Lowe just play off each other to a surprisingly genuine degree; they feel like real people teasing, trying to understand one another, and dancing around when feelings are caught. If you love monster romance, omegaverse (yes, home girl goes all in), and marriage of convenience--I am begging you to pick this up and give it a chance.<br/><br/>Hazelwood also creates a strong conflict and history in this world that feels so seamless I worry people aren't going to give her flowers. It's just neat. The world is neat; the characters have different skill sets that I wasn't expecting (I would have dropped everything sooner if you told me Misery was a hacker!); and I love how bold the author is for essentially telling the reader a big secret that Misery has to figure out. The dramatic irony works when she's interacting with Lowe. I never feel frustrated; I feel like I'm picking up all the double meanings out the gate.<br/><br/>Truly my only critique is that secret's reveal. It could have had so much more punch for Misery to find out in the climax <spoiler>if it was like Meg confidently telling Hades that Hercules has no weaknesses and womp womp it's you girlie!!</spoiler> but it doesn't take away from the story for me. You might find more Hazelwood books on my tbr :)",

   "My Review": "I absolutely love how our entire perception of Commander Graham Gore is now shaped by Bradley's novel--does she understand how powerful that is? For me to fall in love with a characterized version of a real man who died 200+ years ago and we only have one photo of? I hope she knows.<br/><br/>This is definitely one of those books you just have to read--which might sound unhelpful but <i>trust</i> me, the more blind you go into this, the more you'll be pulled in. But for a little more specific information: The prose is so personal; I love how the nameless protagonist is essentially documenting her year as a housemate to a naval officer from 1845 to the reader similarly to how she's documenting everything to the Ministry. The romance is a charming and realistic friends-to-lovers. And there is great build-up to something going terribly terribly wrong as time travel often encourages.<br/><br/>I feel like I need to reread to fully understand some plot points, and the time traveling logic is very much a 'just go with it' vibe with little explanation on the <i>how</i> of things which is never my favorite way of going about any sci-fi technology. Bradley put so much effort into giving me information about the past; I wish she put a little more effort into the futuristic time door.",

   "My Review": "3.5 ⭐<br/><br/><i>Mom, I want to reread The Cruel Prince!<br/>We have The Cruel Prince at home.<br/>The Cruel Prince at home:</i><br/><br/>That might not be an entirely fair assessment, but it was certainly my persistent thought up until the midpoint of <i>A Court of Thorns and Roses</i>. This introduction into Maas's fae series is quite the slowburn, not just in its romance but also in its story. Up until the midpoint where we reach our Fire Night scene, Feyre's journey is relatively stagnant for someone who was kidnapped by a dangerous creature and forced to live with him away from everything she's ever known. As readers, we don't worry for her family's potential starvation the way she does. It's just not something we care about considering their negative/harmful relationship to her and how Tamlin (the fae who kidnaps her) seemingly takes care of them in her absence. As much as I hate how a lot of faerie lore is tossed out the window, I was really hoping they would use the sudden ability to lie in a meaningful way. What if Tamlin isn't actually taking care of them the way he says he is? That would have made Feyre's insistence to find a loophole and escape something we can actually grab onto and want to follow her through that thought-process. But no; it's just faerie lore tossed out the window.<br/><br/>What does grab my attention is the introduction of Rhysand, a potentially even more dangerous High Lord of the Night Court. He's the wrench that actually gets the plot-ball rolling because he adds conflict, fear, stakes, momentum--you get the idea. Up until he walks into Tamlin's dining room, all of the relationships between characters feels muddled (outside of the three sisters; that's clear and great). It's only when Rhysand enters the chat that I actually feel any real connection between Feyre, Tamlin, and Lucien. They're finally being confronted with something and have to do so together and in their own way. I wish there was more brewing tension before Rhysand's arrival; it's like the characters are all waiting for the next big thing to happen the same way you wait for the train to arrive for your morning commute--not when you're tied to the tracks, clawing at your restraints, counting down the seconds until the train strikes you.<br/><br/>The trials are great. I love how everything has weight, how everyone uses Feyre for their own gain, and ultimately, how love triumphs all. There's plenty of foreshadowing of what is to come next, and the book ends on a comforting note that leaves you itchy for the next installment. I gotta wait 20 weeks though for my copy from the library so don't wait up.",

   "My Review": "I need a whiteboard to properly draw out this messy, messy family. I'm assuming/hoping Barnes has one stashed away somewhere to make sure she kept track of everything. The beginning of this book honestly dragged for me and caught my attention as plot threads became more and more complicated. But with that complication came convolution, and Barnes struggles to hold <i>The Hawthorne Legacy</i> on that tightrope. Compels me though. The love triangle is still vague; it's pretty clear who she'll choose considering how much time and energy she spends with one over the other. There's moments where Avery isn't sure, but I love how it's more about her feeling like there's no one for her rather than both. The seaside romance Max brings up is honestly the best recurring motif, and I wasn't expecting to enjoy that question haunting Avery as she continues trekking through the nightmare that is her new life: <i>Close your eyes. Picture yourself standing on a cliff overlooking the ocean. The wind is whipping in your hair. The sun is setting. You long, body and soul, for one thing. One person. You hear footsteps behind you. You turn. Who's there?</i>",

   "My Review": "Edit: Okay I think I'm distanced enough now to give a proper written review<br/><br/>I'm so satisfied with the conclusion of this trilogy and the third book as a whole. Bardugo wraps this trilogy with intentional hands, offering us final darklina moments, a plot twist that I did not see coming but is a jaw-dropping-oh-my-gosh-this-changes-everything-that's-so-good twist that's been coming since book 1, and some cool expansions to both Alina's power and the world at large. With such a large death count too, I was really worried for all my favorite characters. The tension and stakes are ever-present, and if you forget for one second, Bardugo choses the right moment to make sure you don't.<br/><br/><spoiler>I know a lot of people don't like it when the female lead loses/sacrifices her powers at the end, but I think this is a rare instance where this works on every level. Welcome to my brief video essay. Firstly, she thought she would be ascending to the highest form of power and claimed the exact opposite. She didn't willingly sacrifice her powers because she didn't know that would be the consequence. Secondly, her connection to the Darkling is severed forever because now \"she is nothing\". When he realizes that he is now forever alone in the world--heartbreaking--her realizing that he can never haunt her in the same way again--amazing. Thirdly, her and Mal finally get to live their ordinary life! The one they tried to escape to and the one that they thought they could never have is now here. I'm crying. It's brilliant. She won't outlive him; they can run into the meadow whenever they want; they are free to choose each other without the obligations of sainthood or queenhood or anything else Alina didn't want to be since the beginning. You are welcome to disagree, go write fanfic.</spoiler><br/><br/>I have to add some of my favorite quotes because they will live rent free in my head forever:<br/><i>\"You could have made me a better man.\"/\"You could have made me a monster.\"</i><br/><i>\"I am not ruined. I am ruination.\"</i><br/><i>\"Beauty was your armor. Fragile stuff, all show. But what's inside you? That's steel. It's brave and unbreakable. And it doesn't need fixing.\"</i><br/><i>\"He watches her the way Harshaw watches fire. Like he’ll never have enough of her. Like he’s trying to capture what he can before she’s gone.\"</i><br/><i>\"I’ve never understood this taste for otkazat’sya. Is it because you thought you were one of them for so long?”/“I had a taste for you, once.\"</i><br/><i>\"They had an ordinary life, full of ordinary things—if love can ever be called that.\"</i>",

   "My Review": "2.5 ⭐<br/><br/>It's hard to review a book that shouldn't exist...or at the very least a book that should not be a direct sequel to <i>The One</i>.<br/><br/>We don't have any opportunity to sit in the weight of Book 3's ending. It was the first time we see death on a personal level in this series, and it's a complete waste not to mourn for people you've made us care about. We're supposed to believe that America's journey is over when that cannot be further from the truth. Wrapping up the revolution loose ends in their first year of marriage should have been the 4th and final book and this subsequence Heir/Crown duology should have come later.<br/><br/>That being said, I've tried to give this book a fair shake. After all, it does exist despite my protest. I like that Eadlyn is a dislikable character; her unique position as the first female heir mixed with her privileged position means she's distant, unsympathetic, and shallow. Which makes for great conflict with the relationship she has with herself, the Selected, and the country at large.<br/><br/>However, Eadlyn doesn't become someone we can root for or root against. There's sparse moments where we as the reader want her to disrupt the Selection or embrace it. I simply don't care nearly as much because the stakes aren't worrisome. With America, she could be eliminated at any moment, and there's real fear in Maxon's decision to keep or boot her. With Eadlyn, she is the one eliminating. I like how the author makes us root for a lot more of the Selected instead of the original trilogy's love triangle, but unfortunately that means that all of them would make a great choice and I'm not as worried about who she chooses. (Team Erik though if I get any say).<br/><br/>I also would be amiss if I didn't mention the pacing. What has worked for Kiera Cass in the past is not working here. There was nothing satisfying about Eadlyn finally taking the Selection seriously the same way it's satisfying for America to take her role as the Selected seriously. And I think it has to do with everything I've already mentioned. I imagine this book would have been more successful if we ended part 1 with her flip in priorities/motivations and continued forward without a cliffhanger. I'm determined to finish out this series, but unfortunately, I don't have the same excitement.",

   "My Review": "3.5 ⭐<br/><br/>Did this book put a spell on me? Am I cursed? The urgency in which I needed to read this story is unnatural. The need for me to compile an angry playlist for EvaJacks is vicious.<br/><br/>The pacing in <i>The Ballad of Never After</i> is way better than its predecessor. The story beats are much more fleshed out, and there is a stronger balance between the tense/action moments and the calm/recovery moments. I will remember this one a lot more than I will the first; every interaction adds more and more tension between Evangeline and Jacks, and we get a stronger understanding for his actions even when they hurt. Especially when they hurt. I still think it's hard for me to fully fall for him the way I'm so clearly meant to because I've dated guys who don't know how or refuse to express their true feelings and that's why it only works in fantasy. But I'm hopeful that the third will force him to do what he's been holding back from so far.<br/><br/>And what continues to make me so conflicted is the obviousness of story elements vs the obliviousness of our leading gal. I like that Evangeline is naïve and trusting and wants to see the good in people; that makes her a great foil to Jacks and ultimately defines her as a person. But she's also categorized and seen as clever and contemplative; she's constantly trying to figure out Jacks thoughts/motives/feelings and there are key moments where she gets herself out of a bind by outsmarting the people around her or using something she shouldn't know to her advantage. Her actions and important \"I didn't think before I acted\" moments in this book contradict with what we've already established, and I can't stand it. <spoiler>(The major exception being her finally realizing that she loves Jacks and could potentially break his curse through the power of love; that makes sense that she didn't think about that before now. But you're gonna tell me that she didn't once think that the arch hidden away behind a magically-locked door supposedly holding the Valor secrets could in fact be the Valory arch she's swore not to open? Crazy.)</spoiler>",

   "My Review": "Winter is the longest book I've ever read, but it never felt weighed down, sluggish, or off-pace. There are many moments within this finale that are genuinely jaw-dropping/fan-girling/running around your room. At this point, Meyer is having point of view switches for every major character and the book reads like a movie because of it. The most cinematic book I've ever read, and I never grew bored. I'm amazed at how Meyer can deviate her titular characters in terms of personality, actions, and inner thoughts while also managing for them to work together in unexpected and natural ways. The same goes for romance pairs. You'd think Meyer couldn't invest us into a fourth couple, but she caught me in a snar with a princess/body-guard trope. I love how everyone collides here. No one feels wasted. Every victory and defeat is earned. The revolution is natural and realistic. Genuinely, this series as a whole has taught me plenty about being a better writer and it's become part of my identity. I cannot recommend it enough.",

   "My Review": "Oh boy, I knew I was automatically going to like Cress as a short techie gal myself but I was not prepared for how well Meyer would bring her and Thorne closer through the most harrowing, gruesome journey seen in this series so far. Meyer goes into overdrive with page after page of new character dynamics, rising stakes, and romantic beats. These elements are within the first two books for sure, but they are elevated a few notches in the third book. I immediately borrowed Winter within a heartbeat of reading this one. If I had any critique or dislike for this book, it would be how Scarlet gets the short end of the stick when it comes to her screen time and situation. We just finished an entire novel with her as the central character, and I especially became invested with her and Wolf. However, with so many active players, I can be sad but understand why Meyer chose Scarlet for her plot thread.",

   "My Review": "4.5 ⭐<br/><br/>The way I kept looking behind me while reading this book. Erin Craig knows how to use my imagination against me in her writing. She's a horror novelist through and through; even as I was terrified in my own home, I kept reading into the witching hour because the story is so gripping. Everything works: the setting of an isolated town, a close-knit community with long-standing grudges, unknown monsters beyond the forest line, and a lead who must keep her family afloat through the turmoil that follows. The seasonal sections and the throws of surviving winter reminds me of <i>The Grace Year</i>, and the moments of reprieve are not just enjoyable but hold hidden meaning that will come important later.<br/><br/>I wish the bees held a little more importance in the climax; I expected her skills and affinity for the bees to help her understand the threat better but the way they stand is perfectly fine, especially as it relates to her familial relationships and her own sense of self. And ironically I wish the titular Small Favors were more ever-present. I was like 80% of the way through this book and was like \"where are the small favors?\". I can understand keeping this a secret from the main character and by extension the reader, but the title and synopsis explicitly reference how these monsters ask for small favors and we only experience *one* first-hand. Feels like a missed opportunity to either keep that thread a secret or have favors pile on top of each other until they escalate into something dangerous. Still great otherwise.",

   "My Review": "I'm conflicted. I breezed through this book; my heart raced trying to piece the story together and find out what Evangeline would do next to get out of her bind. But while there were definitely fun elements and shocking moments throughout this story, it is a little too chaotic. A lot of the story beats breeze by as quickly as I read them. There's deals with gods, an ironclad prophecy, vampires, a murder mystery, an attempted murder mystery, a never-ending gala that ends after its first day, several weddings, multiple enchantments, and a lot more I'm sure I've forgotten since starting this. I wish we slowed down to flesh out these beats more because the small reprieves we do have between characters are by far the standout.<br/><br/>I also couldn't help but feel like I was being talked down to. As though the author didn't trust me enough to pick up on emotional ques or foreshadowing beats. Thankfully it's not throughout the entire book but definitely glaring when there.",

The Darkling is back as the source of Alina's terror and comfort, and would you judge me if those were my favorite parts of the book? The \"like calls to like\" motif is chefs kiss and a great throughline for a lot of the conflict, internal turmoil, and even world expansion. Strumhond is a great addition to the Grishaverse as a Han Solo type, and even though I completely spoiled myself in regards to him by reading <i>Six of Crows</i> first, picking up all the foreshadowing was thoroughly enjoyable. Poor Mal--just poor Mal. I'm feverishly awaiting whoever is borrowing the third and final installment to give it to me as soon as possible. I have no idea what's going to happen, but I'm ready to find out.<br/>",

   "My Review": "What do you mean this is a standalone?! I could read so much more. So creative and clever. I love how human Craft is the most coveted and dangerous ability to eternal beings, and I love what Margaret Rogerson has to say with that juxtaposition. The worldbuilding is so natural despite my little knowledge of fae mythos, and the writing style just adds to the whimsical, surrealist world we find ourselves in. After reading some other fae-related work, this one by far has the most grotesque depiction, which again, works so well for the story at hand.<br/><br/>I really wish there was a sequel or even a trilogy! Not that this book leaves you on a cliffhanger or is unsatisfactory in any way--the ending just has a great jumping off point for what could happen next. <spoiler>I desperately want to know if and how the fair ones begin to change seeing themselves with human traits. I want to see the marriage between Rook and Isobel and the trials they must face as the first human/fae couple to not only exist but be the king and queen of the entire court. Ah!</spoiler><br/><br/>I also wish we spent more time in the beginning chapters with Rook and Isobel as she paints him. Drawing out that process would have made me believe in their connection sooner as intended rather than later. Give me some more <i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i> moments if you will.<br/><br/><img src=\"https://media1.tenor.com/m/lQkXmHoeiH8AAAAC/oliver-twist.gif\" width=\"150\" height=\"130\" alt=\"please sir may I have some more meme\"></image>",

   "My Review": "This book shredded me to pieces. Everything we've been building toward is here and ready to fall apart in the best way. There are so many setups and payoffs; the expected was just as satisfying as the unexpected. I don't think I've wanted to talk about my progress into a book series more than I have this year with <i>The Selection</i>. The DRAMA. So many quality moments, dialogue exchanges, and jaw-dropping tension. The letters, you guys? Wrecked me. The death toll? Insane. I did expect reality tv to play more into this series as a whole since this is pretty much the Bachelor in a dystopian kingdom setting, but America just causes drama herself. She doesn't need any help there (in the best and worse way), and she does not back down against anyone in <i>The One</i>.<br/><br/>What became maddening was America's dishonesty. So many times she had the chance to come clean about her personal guard being her ex-boyfriend and tell the prince her true feelings, but she kept quiet. Home girl could cleverly outsmart the king in front of the entire nation (my FAVORITE part of the entire series) but could not say I love you first. The author goes to great lengths for us to understand her hesitant point of view, but that doesn't stop me from pacing my house and pretending to jump off my balcony...which I guess is what you want from a reader in the first place.",

   "My Review": "At first, I was worried this book was going to drag <i>hard</i> while America fumbled between her first love (now a royal guard) and her new love (the literal prince). We all know she should choose the prince. And the author knows this too because we get a lot more insight into the prince's personal life, motivations, and contradictories. There were times where I genuinely hated him, and that helped drive the decision making into something much more daunting and ambiguous. I love the increased rebel activity as the country's unrest becomes much more unstable, and I adore how America refines her brave nature by outwardly fighting back against the system at play. It was there in the first book when she personally lead her maids to a safe room (and became their friends), but Kiera Cass takes full advantage of her background in a poor caste to stand out against the remaining girls. We also get closer to the royal family as the contestants dwindle, and I'm excited to see how the king starts to become the main antagonist of the story while the Northern rebels become potential allies.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the second book does get a little muddled between the initial book and the showstopper of a third. A lot of what I'm saying here also applies to <i>The One</i> and I think I'll find myself rereading the first or third books more often for my favorite moments than this one. Still, an excellent second entry and a worthwhile read.<br/>",

   "My Review": "I keep toggling between a 4 and a 5 so let's just do 5. I did not expect to get as engrossed in this story as I did; I honestly put this book off for a long time because of the main character's name. I've gotten used to it but I'm still kind of put off. Her name does have a deeper meaning, but it takes a little too long for us to get there. What Kiera Cass does best though is pacing. Every chapter made me want to start the next, and I found myself shocked to be so close to the ending. I felt like I just began! I can tell you already that the next two books do this exceedingly well, too. Everything in the first book just works: the conflict between her first love and her new love, the contest and its trials/eliminations, and whether or not America wants to take this all seriously. Could she truly be princess material?<br/><br/>Looking back, I must say that the confidant angle didn't go as far as I wanted. Prince Maxon and America understand that she's just here to eat cake and recover from her breakup, so they team up as friends. There's a few times where she helps steer him in the direction of a few girls, but not a lot of the story or their initial time together is devoted to that. I would have loved to see a few more scenes where she's mapping out all the girls, giving him advice on conversation, and who to mingle with until she realizes she wants that attention too. I also wish that the book was a little longer so we could have more time with each contestant, at least the ones who become the final six that start the next book. I didn't know anything about half of them when they were announced, but that leaves room to explore them better in <i>The Elite</i>.",

   "My Review": "A classic in its own right. I found myself enjoying the slower pace, how each scene flows into the next, and how organic the plot progresses. Bella's complete lack of self-preservation is something we probably made fun of in 2008 but is oddly relatable reading and writing in the supernatural romance genre today (oddly enough I think of Cruel Prince for comparison). Her internal monologue is also endearing most of the time--you get a real sense of being the new kid, the anxieties that come with trying to blend in, and how uncomfortable it can be to stand out. I also loved the genuine moments of teenage love between her and Edward. Hiding under the covers (while her dad is downstairs) talking about jealousy and intimacy is the most giddy, kicking my feet moment I wasn't expecting.<br/><br/>The most glaring problem with the romance is how often Edward tells her to stay away from him and that they shouldn't be together. I understand there's a real danger in their courtship and they're staying together despite their better judgement, but the sheer amount of reminders doesn't offer them any favors.",

   "My Review": "It's giving rudimentary YA Fantasy. The foundation of what we have today within the genre. The underdog gains world-shattering powers, the morally-grey villain is great in his role, and we dive headfirst into a well-thought out fantasy world divided quite literally in two. Really enjoyed the progression of Alina's character and power development. Thoroughly enjoyed the small pieces of complexity we earned from the Darkling. Even just him being an Amplifier makes Alina's body conflict with her mind and that is *chef's kiss*. However, the foreshadowing is a little too obvious and large parts of the plot progression make sense but aren't satisfying.<br/><br/>Reading the <i>Six of Crows</i> duology first tells me that Bardugo just gets more comfortable and crazy in her world as she writes more so you best believe I'm picking up book 2.",

   "My Review": "Oh dear, I'm falling into the Grishaverse aren't I?<br/><br/>Heist movies always heighten my anxiety--what's going to go wrong, how are they going to pivot, who will survive--and <i>Six of Crows</i> delivers on all fronts and more. Bardugo makes juggling six POVs look easy; all of the characters have detailed backstories that are naturally revealed as the story progresses, skillsets that are tested to their limits, and motivations that are deeply rooted and often conflict with each other. There's so many little set-ups and pay-offs that keep you on your toes, and I thoroughly enjoyed the pieces of friendship and romance scratching its way to the surface.<br/><br/>The world is also so easy to see and breathe and experience. This is my first step into the Grishaverse, but I already feel like I belong there. Which is so odd to say because there is no way I would realistically survive in a criminal setting as Ketterdam. I'm reeling to read the second.",

   "My Review": "I did not know hunger until I consumed this book in 2 days. My word. I relate to our main character Evie too well; I'm more than convinced that Hannah Nicole Maehrer was the one spying on me through my bedroom posters instead of the boy bands I fantasized about.<br/><br/>Finally a man who falls in love with a woman's humor and honesty in the YA Fantasy genre. I did not know I craved such a pairing: the brooding villain and the one person who makes him laugh. It's Grumpy/Sunshine to be sure but Evie's dark humor and off-beat comments adds an extra layer to the trope. She's capable of violence and mischief and that makes their dynamic all the more enticing. I'm giggling, kicking my feet as I write this review and recall all the moments they share together. Which is a lot and I still crave more.<br/><br/>I will admit that the writing style is something you have to push through in the beginning. It's almost cringy reading Evie's first inside thoughts that often become outside thoughts, but the writing only strengthens as you read and I enjoyed the plot and character exchanges way too much to care.<br/><br/><img src=\"https://media.tenor.com/Ff9pqUUQj0oAAAAC/gordon-ramsay-finally.gif\" />",

Fuston manages to balance humor, gravity, fear, and excitement in her writing style and character interactions. I often found myself rereading sentences just because I couldn't get over how beautifully crafted they were. And there were moments where I laughed out loud and cried to no one in particular. Nothing is wasted; everything has its place. I love the message and mystery, themes and surprises. This book feels so real and grounded for a story revolved around vampires and their mythos. If I book a trip to New Orleans, don't be surprised.<br/><br/><blockquote>This city is a vampire--beautiful and old and seductive, living off the energy of the people it attracts. I do love the night already, the way the neon bar signs contrast with the old gas lamps and make the puddles of water from the summer thunderstorms glow like portals to another place and time, but nobody steps in them because nobody wants to be anywhere but here.</blockquote>",

   "My Review": "Barnes still knows how to enthrall me six years later with <i>The Inheritance Games</i>. For context, I had no idea that this author also wrote <i>The Naturals</i>, a book I read in high school for my Forensic Science class. She uses a lot of the same concepts, tropes, and mysteries here, just more in lieu with <i>Pretty Little Liars</i> and <i>Knives Out</i> than <i>Criminal Minds</i>.<br/><br/>The story works really well building upon layers of mystery with a cast of eccentric characters who express themselves as one thing while hiding something else beneath the surface. I enjoyed trying to figure out the clues myself before our main character Avery did, and I love every detail the author goes to show the complete disconnect between extreme wealth and the lifestyle our lead is used to.<br/><br/>However, in order to have a lot of suspects, a lot of characters end up underutilized or not necessary for the story at large. And the love triangle that takes up most scenes alongside the scavenger hunt isn't all that believable. Despite devoting so much time to Grayson and Jamie alongside Avery, their relationship to her comes off as surface-level and unearned. We get one or two scenes of a better understanding but we needed so much more for this love triangle to functionally work. I imagine the second book will dig its claws deeper into the romance trope, but as of right now, Barnes could have easily removed some elements and made this a great standalone.",

   "My Review": "I am a fool for this book. An absolute fool.<br/><br/>Marissa Meyer writes Lewis Carroll's wonderland world well (try saying that 5 times fast). I fell in love by the end of Chapter 1 with Catherine's character and realizing she was late because the Cuckoo clock cuckoo fell asleep. That is just the beginning of how involved this wonderland is and how the characters move through it. And Jest is so utterly charming. His introduction is so intricate; I imagine Meyer wrote these chapters with a Cheshire grin on her face. I found myself re-reading their meet-cute, and every time there was an <i>inkling</i> he could show up on the page, I was in as much anticipation as Catherine was. I'm in more shambles than I expected with the ending. Do not take the happy ending of the Lunar Chronicles for granted with this one!",

   "My Review": "3.5 ⭐<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed most of this book, about 3/4ths. The conflict is clear, devastating, and well-paced. Real Violet Evergarden vibes with its emphasis on writing letters that connect us together, which I adore. My heart was on fire when the story really kicks off, when Iris makes a decision that is so shocking and unexpected, it felt like she took control of the narrative. Threw everyone ready to play their parts for a complete loop, including myself as reader.<br/><br/>My criticism is a compound of little things becoming large, irritating problems that are easy to rant about. First and foremost, if you're looking for a rivals-to-lovers or an enemies-to-lovers as this book markets itself, then you'll be severely disappointed. The first chapter is so well done establishing Roman and Iris as competitors for the same position, but after that first interaction, their rivalry is lukewarm at best. Jesus would spit it out. If we were going to do a 5 month time jump between the Prologue and Chapter 1, we need more context for Roman and Iris's relationship. How long have they been competing? What are other past examples not yet revealed when they faced off? All we get is a comment or two about winning/losing but not anything we can latch on to. We're just told and expected to be in agreeance. I enjoyed when Roman shows up in the latter half of the book and Iris is convinced he's there to one-up her. That was fun. We needed more of that in the beginning. Now if you're here for a love story where the boy falls hard, then you're in the right place because boy oh boy does Roman fall HARD and it's glorious.<br/><br/>Secondly, and this bothered me as an editor/writer, why is Iris calling her mother by her first name? It would have been an incredible literary device for Iris's POV to use Aster when she's actively separating her mother from the alcoholic she has to deal with. Aster is used randomly and seems to only break up the word \"mom\" when that's not necessary. There's another line later on about how every woman in her family is named after flowers, but we didn't need Aster before this for us to understand. Just one line about \"hey my mom's name is Aster and mine is Iris isn't that neat\" and we're good.<br/><br/>And then thirdly, Iris needed more internal dialogue. I always understood how Roman felt and why he did things. The ending especially is when I needed Iris to explain herself the most. The ending is great; it's tense, there's drama, regret, and loss but Iris is way too passive afterwards. I need to know why because everything else about her character screams otherwise. Just a few lines Rebecca. I needed a few lines to just gaslight me into believing her final actions are justified and a little more internal dialogue to understand what she'll do in the sequel.",

   "My Review": "\"Heir of Blood and Secrets\" is the comfort must-read for fans of YA dystopia. Surprising twists and turns knotted my stomach and kept me engaged throughout. The world of Devovea is lively with cyberpunk aesthetics, classist tension, and racial undertones--a recipe for delicious disaster. Linda Xia’s writing style also contributes to a well-paced and consistently escalated story. Even in the lighthearted moments of the book, the stakes are daunting. I look forward to the next installment!<br/><br/>*Update*: Bumped up to a 5 because I still think about this book on a regular basis. Incredibly memorable and I might re-read, which I hardly do.",

   "My Review": "I'm devastated, but what else did I expect from a World War 2/Nazi story? If you love <i>The Book Thief</i> or <i>JoJo Rabbit</i>, this one is also a must-read. They share a lot of similar themes, but what Doerr does to stand apart is a dual pov between a Hitler youth and a blind French girl as they understand the world and time they share + a string of metaphors that always (by some miracle) makes you feel detached from the horrid reality and closer to it.<br/><br/>In all honesty, if I can be honest with you, this book gives me delulu confidence that I too can be a Pulitzer Price winner. Not because it's bad but because the prose starts simple and becomes more complicated over time and I love figurative language. Maybe I never will just because this is a World War 2 book and people tend to love these kinds of stories. I also read stuff in this book that I read before on tumblr posts <i>twice</i> and though they fit well within the story, I can't get that preface out of my mind. Maybe Doerr wrote about the boiling frog metaphor and 'history is written by the winners' speech first, but it took me out of the story so fast. I could not properly recover.",

I love how the Erlking always reminds you of his cruelty as he also shows something more sincere. Meyer teases an enemies to lovers, and I am not complaining. You really feel like you're in the main character's shoes too. Never quite knowing where she stands, if she's making the right choices, and always, always discovering something unexpected and new as the story twists and turns. If you're a writer as much as a reader of fairy-tale retellings, this duology (and Meyer as a whole) is a must read.",

   "My Review": "The closest Marissa Meyer has gotten to writing a Fae story, and I am incredibly thankful. What a rollercoaster. I was worried about the main character the entire time and for good reason. As usual, none of the characters are wasted and the romance had me swooning on their third interaction. The pacing does suffer a little from the monthly schedule the story sets for itself but that could also be my impatience to see the Erlking again. Started the second immediately.",

Holly Black tends to do that to me in this series, and I'm still surprised. Something that has fascinated me throughout this whole series is the relationship between Jude and her adopted father and <i>The Queen of Nothing</i> uses that dynamic to its fullest extent. The same goes for the romantic beats between Cardan and Jude, the familial moments between Jude and her two sisters, and her friendships within the Court of Shadows. Everything comes to fruition for better or for worst. Time to go buy the Barnes & Noble exclusive edition to read those letters!!",

A lot more forced proximity is at play which bodes well for an enemies-to-lovers, and I found myself staying up later and later at night just so I could read it more. I genuinely wish I could draw just so I could create fanart of my favorite scenes. Characters who are background players are used more as the stakes escalate, and I love how the Undersea and Nicasia bring a dangerous complexity to both the world of Faerie and Jude/Cardan's relationship.

   "My Review": "The Cruel Prince is actually cruel let's go! I couldn't wait to read this book, and I'm so glad that the pacing and sentence structure makes this for an easy read. Jude is a relentlessly relatable main character who takes her hits, gets back up, and learns to be more clever as she goes. I loved every interaction she had with Cardan; none of them miss and Holly Black is smart when Jude's thoughts go to him when he's not there. You think about someone you hate just as much as you think about someone you love, and this book takes every opportunity to own that. Though I figured out pieces of the third act, there were still surprises along the way and great moments to see characters in a new light. I am steamrolling into my fae phase.",

   "My Review": "4.5 ⭐<br/><br/>Murder mystery meets 12 Dancing Princesses = a shocking, dark and terrifying read. The world Erin Craig introduces is so well done, natural, and eases you in. None of the exposition feels like it's being fed to you or out of place. I could not figure out the mystery as the story unfolded before me, but the reveal makes so much sense once everything falls into place. And the supernatural touches made this for a much more enticing read. There are a few loose ends in terms of side characters (Ivor is introduced in a way that makes him feel important but then he's not) and I often melted the sisters together because there are 12 of them and the most memorable ones are dead. To give Craig credit where credit is due, the attention to detail strengthens when she focuses in on one sister or a group of them for some great scary/tense scenes. Will be reading Book 2!",

The world is well-thought out in all its disturbing glory. I can't believe this book fooled me. Shocks cover to cover, and the ending is no different.

   "My Review": "What a triumph! I remember when Xiran Jay Zhao first uploaded their Mulan 2020 rant and suddenly dropped how they were also an author releasing this book. I was instantly intrigued by its premise and though it took me a while to pick it up (a la waiting for the library to have it), once I did, *Iron Widow* was impossible to put down. Zhao knows how to end each chapter with a mini cliffhanger; I had an intense need to know what happens next, and the story flows well. The first chapter especially sets up so many elements carried throughout the pages, and I loved how unexpectedly funny the dialogue and chapter titles are. I found a lot of my tweens/early teens mentality in Wu Zetian's pov. Shared female experiences weave so well with this sci-fi historical setting. Deserves all the praise it receives. The only note (a microscopic note if you will) I can possibly write about is within the Epilogue. No spoilers; I'll just say that the final twist stretched my suspension of disbelief a little too far. Shattered even. The set up is there, no doubt. I'm just worried the grounded feminist themes are going to get muddled in Book 2 because of this new development, but we'll see what Zhao does. Probably something that will make me eat my words.",

   "My Review": "4.5 ⭐<br/><br/>Layers and layers of quality tension. I was on fire for the entire novel. I found myself rooting for Alessandra at every deceptive turn, and I thoroughly enjoyed when others did it right back to her just to see how she got out of a frustrating situation. As Alessandra and Kallias get closer, I loved how there were multiple reasons why they shouldn't and their forbidden romance is a nice and natural slow burn too. Even when the assassin against the king's life is revealed, I figured out the person but was genuinely surprised by the added why rather than just the who. I give 4.5 stars instead of 5 because there is one part of the book I would have changed if I had written it (will not spoil what for y'all), but I still think that what does happen is anxiety-inducing enough to warrant the decision. I also don't understand fully why this should be a series. I'm really glad for more content and there are loose threads within the background of this story that can be explored further, but I'm also very satisfied with the happy ending.",

   "My Review": "If you love Jane Austen-esque stories about fancy ballrooms, conspiring aunts, and breaking etiquette all wrapped in a flair of magic, you're in the right place. I certainly am. Half a Soul delivers a grounded magical story within Regency England, reminding me most of Pride & Prejudice and Howl's Moving Castle. Dora is the only person who can match wits with Lord Sorcier Elias because of her faerie-cursed condition, and the two find themselves constantly in each other's company to the dismay of everyone else who are within the confines of propriety. I love how their relationship naturally blossoms from a rude introduction to sudden allies, friends, and then lovers. I love how his very presence is often unexpected and pleasing to both the reader and to Dora, and I love how the characters outside of their dynamic hinder or help their cause. The book is concise though, which isn't a drawback until the very end, when the final battle becomes underwhelming by how quickly it passes by. Elias is the Lord Sorcier. Let the man unleash his full power. Make him a little scary so he has the same sense of hesitation and fear as Dora does when their feelings are revealed. The writing style itself is a little stilted in the beginning too, which is fine when Dora doesn't have the same emotional capacity as everyone else, but she has her full soul in the first chapter so I wished the writing reflected that. All in all though, I thoroughly enjoyed this recommendation and I am very interested in reading her other Regency Faerie Tales.",

At first, I still held true to my Book 1 opinion that These Violent Delights could be one large book with the plot threads merged together (since the Lords make Roma and Juliette work together again almost immediately). But the more I kept reading and the more I got hooked, I'm very glad this book is as full and vibrant as it is. All of the character moments are amazing, the plot continously escalates and makes me fearfully look at my wall, and I love--absolutely love--how Gong uses her 3rd person omniscient pov to its creative strengths.",

   "My Review": "4.5 ⭐<br/><br/>This was such a wild ride! Filled to the brim with poetics, danger, and letters. If the first chapter throws you off, do not despair--the world, characters, and actions make more sense as you continue forward. I can see myself annotating this book for hours, and I found the same enjoyment reading this as I do reading Ray Bradbury or Aldous Huxley's work. The only force pushing back a 5/5 is how the transition from enemies to lovers doesn't have the same build up as in other stories. At least in my experience, they say they love each other and there's at least one action Blue takes to prove it right before the confession but it's not enough to convince me of its legitimacy. I still root for them throughout; I just found that most of their longing for each other is unearned.",

   "My Review": "Suzanne Collins dropped the best villain origin story and I completely ignored this book until the movie released. Heavy internal monologue is exactly what we needed to understand Coriolanus as his worldview is challenged, changed, and returned. His descent is natural, well-paced, and you still fear him by the end (which is where most villain origin stories fail). It was really fun placed into the Capitol mindset in comparison to what we know from the original trilogy, and all of the main characters are intriguing with how they pull and push Coriolanus forward. An obvious must-read if you liked The Hunger Games and every interaction Katniss had with President Snow. I'm personally never over when he says, “Oh, my dear Miss Everdeen. I thought we had an agreement not to lie to each other”.",

   "My Review": "Maniscalco surprised me with her final book in this series. Incorporating the Feared was a bold choice and not all of the plot points struck interest (specifically Vesta's murder mystery) but I'm glad for the book's exciting fights and dare-I-say-heartfelt ending. Wrath and Emilia's relationship has completely transformed at this point and you root for them to break their curse. I love how Envy becomes an ally/friend, and Vittoria was by far the most interesting to interact with. I don't mind that there are a few 'loose' ends because as Sloth says, there's always more after a story's close, and that is definitely true for our main character Emilia. When I picked up the first book, I didn't know this was a steamy romance but after finishing the series, I can see myself reading more books in the same genre and maybe even Maniscalco's Stalking Jack the Ripper series.",

   "My Review": "I. Love. This. Book. I cannot overstate how much I love this book so let me try to explain why:<br/><br/>I love how daring this story is. It's unapologetic about its patriarchal structure and how it reflects our own, and I'm shocked at how Liggett somehow weaves every story thread across the entire narrative, dangles those mysterious just above your fingertips, and then reveals everything just as they need to, in their own natural timing. Hardly anything feels wasted despite its 400+ pages. Everything matters. And the themes around womanhood, religion, and love worked well for me (especially as a Christian myself). It feels like a genuine classic collided with the contemporary writing of YA/NA books.<br/><br/>I love how things go wrong and stay wrong. Even in my own writing, it's difficult for me to present real danger (or at least what I consider real danger since I know the entire fate of these characters when I'm an author and not a reader) but Liggett doesn't back down. People die and stay dead. People get hurt and take time to recover. People are cruel and become even crueler. I haven't felt genuine fear for the main character's situation in a long time. I never knew what was going to happen next, and yet everything that did happen made sense once they did, once my eyes were opened to them.<br/><br/>I love that this is a single novel too, even titled with \": a Novel\", since this could so easily be a series if the author wanted to. But either Liggett didn't want to or held a lot of restraint because I think this is the first YA-marketed book I've read that holds the message of small steps forward and actually commits to it. I won't spoil this book for you, so I'll just say that Tierney does exactly what I say: takes action where she can and for those after her.<br/><br/>Please go read this book. I can talk about every facet and once I have nothing left to say, I'll just hand you a small crimpled red flower with five petals.",

   "My Review": "This is a great time with moments of humor, heartbreak, and so much worry. I'd say on par with \"Ever After\" in terms of the best Cinderella story. The author takes great strides in creating a believable sci-fi future and how the characters interweave with their world. Cinder is exactly the kind of heroine you'd root for. There were several times when Cinder surprised me when she took action that made the plot bend to her in unexpected ways. The only real note I have is the story is very much written in the early 2010's (published in 2012 what do you expect) soooooo Cinder does discover a lot of chosen-one energy in three waves by the end of the book. However, these discoveries are well executed with plenty of foreshadowing and payoff. I very much look forward to assembling a Sailor Moon-esque team in the remaining series.",

   "My Review": "I absolutely loved the world, the characters, and the constant stakes that elevated tension or surprised me. Xingyin risks her life often for her goal, and every time, the story didn't offer plot armor or make anything linear/easy. Made me want to reevaluate my own fight scenes and how to include that same feeling of uncertainty and dread. There are a few instances where some actions didn't align well with their characters, or at least, weren't explained enough for me to be convinced. A second book is fun to explore more of the unseen consequences, but I wish this was a standalone. The main character even narrates how her journey has come full circle, so I don't feel all that compelled to read the second.",

The relationship between Wolf and Scarlet is exactly what a monster-lover would want (tagging myself here), and even though his true nature isn't all that subtle, I don't think the author is trying to trick you on that front. In fact, how Meyers intertwines the supernatural with sci-fi and foreshadowing is a great strength here. I'm impatiently waiting for the library to give me Book 3.",

   "My Review": "Going into this story, I was really excited about the enemies-to-lovers and villain-turned-good-for-love tropes at play when you're writing about the literal Princes of Hell. And you definitely get those juicy moments, but I found myself constantly frustrated at the main character, who honestly as I'm writing this I can't remember her name. There's nothing inherently wrong with her, and the story works as is. I just couldn't help but feel a strong desire to rewrite her personality to be a lot kinder and meeker in stark contrast to her new companion. I'd find their dynamic more compelling, his softened heart more natural, and those moments when she does do bad things more shocking. Again, it works as is that she takes on her sister's traits in order to find her killer; I ended up not liking it as much as the alternative. I might read the subsequent books since it ended on a strong note, but I'm on the fence.",

   "My Review": "No one is ever at their house. There's a lot of merits to this book: a dark academia setting, a lot of toying mysteries, and an enticing use of language. However, I find myself incredibly disappointed at the complete normalcy of the plot once you get down to it. Without giving spoilers, the supernatural and I mean in the scariest of terms, does not come back into the story. Its consequences create more consequences but not at the cosmic scale I was expecting and hoping. The other toying mysteries are great but like a double edged sword, are only used to make me read more than to give me any answer, satisfying or unsatisfying. And by God this book is loooooong. I appreciate the patience the author has to write so much detail, but it doesn't bring me any tension or worry for most of the second half. When interesting things do happen in this ladder half, it's again enticing for me to keep reading but is either passed off casually or never addressed again in a meaningful way. Go watch Heathers.",

   "My Review": "I'm amazed at how intentional this book is with its wording, dialogue, and characters. I'm always in Ancient Greece and always on my toes. The romance is believable and heartbreaking, and I honestly became desperate myself toward the end as things turned sour. Its smart for Miller to write the first half as Achilles and Patroclus's budding romance and childhood and then exactly at the midpoint bring them into the Trojan War. However, I must admit that the pacing after chapter three can feel slow as we're building the setting and romance and sometimes the pacing of the war can do the same because it's stretched out over a 10 year timeframe. Miller always finds a way to bring tension back into play, and the long descriptives between Achilles and Patroclus make my heart flutter instead of drag. I don't think this book is categorized as Young Adult, but if it is, would not recommend for younger audiences. Themes around rape, the treatment of women, and explicit sex scenes in general put The Song of Achilles into the New Adult genre, bare minimum.",

   "My Review": "A story made with clear and intentional care from the author. Melinda's voice is distinctly teenage, managing to be authentic without being cringey. To even say \"Melinda's voice\" is ironic because Anderson does a fantastic job getting into her headspace without her speaking outloud throughout most of the novel. I love the story keeping the pace of an entire school year following the incident, and I like how 'the incident' isn't explicitly said until we're nearing the end of the book. We know from context or just reading the synopsis, but Melinda isn't able to properly acknowledge her rape until she's at a point where she can process and tell others. I also love symbolism, so the tree assignment really piqued my intrigue, and I enjoyed the worldbuilding surrounding her school with all the clans, teachers, and classes. Well written and well deserved of its recognition.",

   "My Review": "Absolutely gripping, unflinching, and realistic. There were many ways this book could go and I commend the author for the choices she made in terms of character and consequence. Loved how the ending reflects our current world and not a fantasy version while still being hopeful. I also enjoyed moments of good humor, haunting parallels of the past, and how our main group of teens developed from start to finish. I will admit that the contemporary writing style is sometimes awkward or cringy for me to read and there were points in the book where something was reminded too frequently like it didn't trust us to remember. The biggest example is how many times Starr reminds me that some stores have \"Black Owned\" spraypainted on them. I got it the 1st time, didn't need it the 5th time within the same chapter. Those are minor details and can be chopped up to personal preference. Overall, the writing style is successful in its distinct Starr voice and truly who am I to hinder her greatest weapon?",

   "My Review": "I love how the theme regarding love and hate is threaded throughout this story in its community, political landscape, and its people. I separate community from people because Lee really highlights how individuals are complex and can reflect or oppose the general consensus. At first, I was hesitant with the \"slice of life\" beginning of this book but I quickly became invested. As the plot started rolling, its impact is much more hitting than if it started in the first 3 chapters as books tend to do these days. I can understand why high schools wouldn't want to read it in class just because I can see kids memeing on the frequent n-word but it shouldn't be banned. What really resonated with me about this book is the integrity of Atticus, the mystery of Boo Radley, and the kindness of Scout in unexpected situations.",

   "My Review": "Utterly invested. Reid does so well creating a realistic atmosphere surrounding the hollywood scene, scathing gossip articles, and the triumphs and tribulations of a woman consumed by her persona. There is so much care in Evelyn's story, personality, and perspective. She is written like a true person, and much like Monique (the one who is interviewing her), we find ourselves actively rooting for Evelyn even when she outright refuses that sort of praise. At first, I thought I wouldn't like the storytelling: how Monique's insecure thoughts have a lot to do with the progression of the first several chapters but I adored Evelyn's manner of speech and I enjoyed how that confidence started to influence Monique's point of view too. Evelyn delivers a good amount of hard-hitting quotes that'll stick in my mind, and I'm here for the secret romance she harbors throughout her 7 husbands.",

   "My Review": "4.5 ⭐<br/><br/>Truly, I tell you, my only critique of this twisted tale is in its want for two books. If the story didn't end in the way that it did like a season 1 finale opening the door wide for season 2, there would be better closure writing several more chapters to end this feud or their lives or their familial ties or however else Gong decides is the right ending. I do like, however, how Juliette repays Roma for how he saved her without her understanding and that essentially flips their relationship dynamic on its head for Book 2 to thrive in new and interesting ways alongside the loose story threads introduced but not closed in Book 1.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this dive into 1920's Shanghai and the commentary on race, colonialism, and gender within Juliette's thoughts. The characters are uniquely their own and enjoyable to follow. My favorite character outside of the main duo was Kathleen, and her segments trying to find information were just as riveting as following the gang heirs. There's body horror here, which I was not expecting, but is by far my favorite horror subgenre, and even though a lot of people die from the same infliction, Gong reminds me every time why I want to run away. The enemies to lovers romance is believable and a great slowburn. I'm seriously at a loss as to how they are going to recover in Book 2, but considering how well Gong steers her story here, I'm confident it will be in all the ways I least expect.",

   "My Review": "This book is okay. The writing reflects a drifting mind in its loose sentence structure and becomes easier to read as the perspective gains clarity too. I liked this loose sentence structure the more I read, but it was very difficult to get used to at the beginning. Johnson takes on a prose that reminds me of something I might read for the AP Lit exam, and overall, I became frustrated when scenes became too poetic for me to remain immersed.<br/><br/>The twist and subsequent despondent ending makes sense, and I clearly was intrigued enough to find out since I read this book in one day. Even so, I found myself disappointed. Maybe it was because some of the themes surrounding their father could never be fully formed. Maybe it was because it wasn't a twist that needed to surprise you. I can't completely pinpoint the 'why', and maybe that's what the author intended all along.",

   "My Review": "A story that sucks you in immediately. I absolutely love the way Sylvia Plath uses her words--full of similes and metaphors that weave the narrative in your mind. Highly recommend for fellow gals who have struggled with depression, love poetry, have a fear of pregnancy/marriage, and readers who want a shorter work.",

   "My Review": "What can I say that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece? For a classic, a lot of the situations are humorous, scathing, and awkward. There's literally a scene where Ms. Bingley pretends to read the second volume of a book Mr. Darcy is reading in the hopes of him talking to her. Highly recommend if you like slowburn romances (duh) and listening to the audiobook makes understanding the book *a lot* easier.",
